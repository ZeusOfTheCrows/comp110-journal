\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
The phrase “Turing Test” is ubiquitous in modern society; even if many people do not fully understand the stipulations of the original idea, most still know the general gist.

Turing suggested that rather than attempting to create an entire fully-fledged consciousness from scratch, a simpler—and perhaps more reliable—method would be to create a much more basic "infant" AI, and expose it to a variety of environments in order for it to learn. This expands the problem to something much more easily grasped by a non-technical mind.\cite{Infants}
